Current Version 3.0

Changelog:
	Problem: Have the program delete files
			 that are duplicates. These should
			 be stored in a list so my initial
			 plan is to loop through the list,
			 check the file exists then delete it
			 
	Solution: Implemented the inital plan, with a
			  check to make sure the user wants to
			  delete the files.
