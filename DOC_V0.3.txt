Current Version 3.0

Changelog:
	Problem: Implement feature to allow the user
			 to select which duplicate files they
			 want to keep. 
			 
			 Plan to add a prompt that allows the
			 user to select a set of duplicates
			 and then select which one they wish
			 to keep.
			 
	Solution: Give the user the choice to either
			  keep only the first duplicate from
			  each set, select from each set which
			  dupliacte they want to keep or to 
			  select which sets they want to choose
			  what duplicate to keep, keeping the 
			  first duplicate from the rest of the 
			  sets.
