Duplicate Deleter 1.0

This program will detect duplicate files in a file
directory then give you options for which duplicates
to keep before deleting the rest of the files.

Instructions for use:

Have installed Python 2.7

Open up a command prompt in the location of Duplicate Deleter

Type 'python main.py' into the command prompt and hit enter

You will be asked for the directory you want to scan, if the
directory is inside the location of Duplicate Deleter then
a partial directory path is okay, however a full directory
path is reccomended.

Next you will be given three options for what file types you
want to scan. You can either scan all files, specify a single
file type or specify multiple file types. Please enter the
number next to the option in the program.

The program will then print out all the duplicates found
in sets and also how many sets of duplicates there are.

You will then be given three choices for how you want to determine
which duplicate from a set should be kept. You can either keep the
first file from each set, choose the file from each set or choose
a file from some sets then keep the first from other sets. Please
enter the number next to the option in the program.

Once the duplicate from each set the user wants to keep has been
specified, delete the rest of the files from each set.
